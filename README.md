# Test Metrics AI Dashboard
## Predictive Analytics for QA Testing Optimization
### Author: Neha Pathak


## 1. Project Overview

This project addresses a critical challenge in modern software testing: efficiently analyzing and predicting test failures in large-scale QA operations. Traditional testing approaches often struggle with:
- Identifying testing bottlenecks proactively
- Predicting potential failure areas
- Optimizing resource allocation for testing
- Visualizing testing metrics effectively

## 2. Problem Statement

Quality Assurance teams face several challenges:
- **Time Consumption**: Manual analysis of test metrics is time-consuming
- **Resource Allocation**: Difficulty in prioritizing testing efforts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Complex to identify patterns in test failures
- **Predictive Capability**: Lack of proactive failure prediction
- **Visualization**: Challenge in representing test metrics meaningfully

## 3. Solution Approach

This dashboard implements a machine learning-based solution that:
1. **Analyzes Historical Data**:
   - Test execution times
   - Resource utilization
   - Failure patterns
   - Performance metrics

2. **Predicts Testing Outcomes**:
   - Uses Random Forest algorithm
   - Identifies high-risk test areas
   - Predicts potential failures
   - Suggests optimization areas

3. **Provides Visual Insights**:
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Trend analysis
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource utilization patterns

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Data Processing
- Test execution metrics analysis
